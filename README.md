# ARGB differential receiver
A small-size differential receiver which can be soldered to standard 12mm addressable LED strips. 
- Supports 5-26V input voltage with 20A pass-through.
- Uses a fault-protected receiver, with optional TVS diode when using cheaper alternative parts.
- 12mm x 41.5mm size, can be directly soldered to most LED strips

Designed for use with [my LED controller project](https://github.com/KuglicsL/LED_control).
